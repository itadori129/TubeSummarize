who needs one of mouse when u have two of eyes,
thats the idea behind the eyemousecontroller
and when it works,its amazing
look at the screen drag your face and snap
it'll teleport the place where you wanted
this software will figure out where your face is moving
but there is couple of catches basically u need is good resoultion camera
as a webcam to give every video frame to computer
using a mouse means using your hands lifting your hands clicking
then replacing your hands in your keyboard
in eyemousecontroller u dont need to lift your hand from keyboard
move your face blink and it will click and work like a charm
thats not all recent update added new feature like
invert camera for flip video frames
better illumination settings
aspect ratio changer for more device support
if you stop your face from moving and place near to center to camera
it'll automatically stop moving the cursor
eyemousecontroller even works with number of video games
its pretty cool to shoot or throw virtual boulders just by looking your target
i love eyemousecontroller because of easy replacements of tobii's eye gaze tracker or
other tracker .
it can replace mouse for heavy keyboard centric user ,it will make them never use there hands to use 
mouse 
it can be used by the people with severe disabilities which can use their eye to communicate to the computers
one can see the result what eye tracking technology can work when we using it with interface of a laptops
so basically there will be camera attached to the camera which will detect faces
and basically it will predict the points of your face structure and it will predict yout
where your eyelid is is , and on the basis of that it will click event takes place

based on face moving you actually be telling the computer where to move
